# Sketchpad

Sketchpad is an online browser version of the popular Etch-A-Sketch toy. The 
page default is set to a 16x16 canvas area.  When the user drags the mouse pointer across the canvas area, the grid squares will change colors. 

The initial setting is black on white. 

The 'Random' setting randomly selects a color while moving the mouse pointer across the grid.

Selecting 'Erase' will restore any colored squares back to white.  

To quickly erase the entire canvas, select the 'Clear' button at the bottom of the page.  

To change the grid size, select the 'Change Size' button on the left hand side. (Grid size ranges from 1 to 100)
