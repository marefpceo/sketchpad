# Sketchpad

Sketchpad is an online browser version of the popular Etch-A-Sketch toy. The 
page default is set to a 16x16 canvas area. The user is able to draw on the canvas by pressing, and holding, the left mouse button while dragging across the screen.

## Grid Size

To change the grid size, select the 'Change Size' button on the left hand side. (Grid size ranges from 1 to 100) 

## Color Options

Color options can be selecting using the option buttons in the 'Color' area. 

The initial setting is black on white. 

The 'Random' setting randomly selects a color while moving the mouse pointer across the grid.

Selecting 'Erase' will return any colored squares back to white when drawing on the canvas.  

The 'Select' setting will give the user access to the color palet below, allowing selection of any color. 

To quickly erase the entire canvas, select the 'Clear' button at the bottom of the page.
